## PHYLIS OTIENO
* Designed and developed the tribute page and the profile page.The tribute page has turned out okay since its only supposed to be honest testimonials from the people we've worked with and their experience with the app,while in the profile page a user can edit their profile picture to their own liking.It was a bit of a challenge but i managed to work through the problem.

## MARGARET NDICHU
* I took part on research of literature review and on setting page  which was quite difficult to achieve on how to change theme on the whole PasafiPazuri application.
